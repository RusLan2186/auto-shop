Since 2014, the Cayenne has been sold alongside a smaller Porsche SUV, the Macan. The word Cayenne used by Porsche comes from the cayenne peppers, a moderately hot chili pepper used to flavor dishes.The second-generation Cayenne (Type 92A or E2) was unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show in March. The Cayenne shares its platform, body frame, doors and electronics with the similar Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7. It received a facelift in 2014 with minor external changes, and introduced a new plug-in E-Hybrid version, with its public launch at the Paris Motor Show.[3] Since 2008, all engines have featured direct injection technology. The third generation (Type PO536) was unveiled in 2017 at Stuttgart.",
